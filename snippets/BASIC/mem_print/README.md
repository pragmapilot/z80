* You can use compound instructions in BASIC to do multiple actions in the same line. See lines 2, 3 and 8 for examples
    * While this is good from a mental perspective, as we're aggregating related actions, it may hurt a bit the code readability   
* `TAB` moves the `PRINT` to the column specified and it's good to pad strings
* `LEN` works out the length of the argument string
* `STR$` converts numbers into strings: its argument is a number, and its result is the string that would appear on the screen if the number were displayed by a `PRINT` statement
