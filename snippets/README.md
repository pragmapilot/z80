# Snippets

A collection of simple programs that I used to learn more about Z80 Assembly and microcomputers.

Every program lives in it's own folder and has the following files:

* **Readme** - information about the code:
 * What it is and what was my goal
 * How to run it
 * High-level explanation of what it does
 * What outstanding things I learned from it
* **Source file** - the `.asm` file that contains the Assembly program
* **Makefile** - to easily build and run the code. See [Makefile](../tools/make/README.md) for more details

... to do the following when creating a new project:

* include a `README.md` (see [below](#READMETemplate))
* create a `.gitignore` with the following content:

```
out/ 
```

* test the links (internal and external)

[Here's](./README_Template.md) the `README.md` template to be used on every project.
