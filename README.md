# Z80 learning bits

`Z80 learning bits` is an online repository for my personal notes and snippets on my study of [Z80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80) [Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) on the macOS platform.

## 💭 Motivation 

*(aka "the philosophical stuff...")*

In this era dominated by AI, ML, Big Data, and the Cloud, computation has reached a level of abstraction where Software Engineers often overlook the fundamental details.

Ultimately, everything a Software Engineer does comes down to manipulating bits and bytes stored in registers and memory addresses on some machine, whether it's physical or virtual.

I chose to study Z80 Assembly to delve deeper into the hardware and gain a better understanding of what happens beneath the surface of higher-level abstractions.

I selected the Z80 because it powers the ZX Spectrum, a microcomputer that holds dear memories for me and is simple enough while still possessing most of the characteristics of a modern computer. Z80 is still used today, well-documented, and has a large community.


<a name="Overview"></a>
## 🔎 Overview

This content is organized in three basic sections: 

* **Main** - these notes plus the [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) (where I take notes to myself about what I want to do or study next) and the [License](LICENSE)
* **Snippets** - several Z80 Assembly snippets (usually adapted from somehwere else) with my own personal annotations and comments on the code
* **Tools** - useful templates, tools and diagrams to assist in the study of Z80 Assembly


<a name="Assumptions"></a>
## 📋 Assumptions

To run these snippets it's assumed that you are running on a Mac computer with a modern macOS version and know your ropes around [git](https://docs.github.com/en), [brew](https://brew.sh) and [shell](https://tommcfarlin.com/shells-in-macos/) (I use [zsh](https://www.zsh.org) because it's the default on the system). 

<a name="Tooling"></a>
## 🛠️ Tooling

The tool chain I am using is comprised of the following elements:

* [vim](https://www.vim.org) - editor to write the `.asm` code
* [z80asm](https://www.nongnu.org/z80asm/) - to convert the `.asm` into machine code 
* [bin2tap](http://zeroteam.sk/bin2tap.html) - to convert the machine code to the [TAP](https://sinclair.wiki.zxnet.co.uk/wiki/TAP_format) format used by most emulators
* [Fuse for macOS](https://fuse-for-macosx.sourceforge.io) - as the ZX Spectrum Emulator to run and test the Assembly code
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) - to orchestrate the build and execution pipeline 

### Tool installation

`vi` and `make` should be installed by default on your macOS. If they're not check [here](https://www.vim.org/download.php) and [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/#download).

Part of the tooling will be installed via **Homebrew**. You can find installation instructions [here](https://brew.sh).

To install `z80asm` use it's `brew` [formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/z80asm): 

```
brew install z80asm
```

To install `bin2tap`, first download the latest build from and then do the following in the shell:

```
cd
mkdir build
cd build
unzip ../Downloads/bin2tap13.zip
gcc -o bin2tap bin2tap.c
cp bin2tap ~/local/bin/
cd
rm -rf build
```

**Don't forget to add it to the $PATH!** I added it to the [.zshrc](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/zsh-configuration-files#3-zshrc) for commodity.

To install `Fuse for macOS` use `brew` once again ([formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/fredm-fuse#default)):

```
brew install --cask fredm-fuse
```
