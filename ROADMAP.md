# 🛣️ Roadmap

In this section I will keep a record of what I am doing at the moment and what I work to work on next.

<a name="InProgress"></a>
## 🏃 In Progress

* Creation of the git repo content 
	* **Snippets**: review, test and document (README.md) the various snippets I already have; all the Makefiles need to change to the version in tools/make which was updated on 6/Nov
 
* Finish [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2gw36OyX3g) and fix the bugs. Publish it to `snippets`
 
<a name="FutureScope"></a>
## 🔮 Future scope

* Write a snippet with code exercising all the Z80 addressing modes

* Finish all Darryl Sloan tutorials (3 & 4)

* Create a project that does not use `bin2tap` `-b` option (add the loader) and understand how the code can be manually copied to the memory and executed
	* Will need updates to `Makefile`. Reflect this on the `README.md` 

* Enhance `tools/useful_ROM_routines` with more content from TCSRD (maybe don't include stuff like tape and printer ones since it is not very useful to modern emulation context?)
 
* Invesigate and document POKEs
	* [Stackoverflow Poke in ZX Spectrum](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37628242/poke-in-zx-spectrum)
 	* [POKEs Database for ZX Spectrum V2.5](https://github.com/ladyeklipse/all-tipshop-pokes)
 
* Advance Machine Code Loaders
